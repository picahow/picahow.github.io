                <p>A Malaysian classic that’s always a crowd-pleaser. The tender, marinated meat skewers grilled to perfection and served with rich peanut sauce are absolutely delicious. It’s one of my favorite dishes to enjoy during gatherings or celebrations.</p>

                <p>A flaky and crispy Malaysian flatbread that I absolutely love. It’s golden and buttery on the outside, soft and slightly chewy on the inside, and is typically served with a side of curry or dhal for dipping. I enjoy the contrast of textures and the satisfaction of tearing apart each layer. It’s a breakfast favorite that’s comforting, flavorful, and perfect with a cup of tea.                </p>

                <p>A savory and addictive Malaysian fish snack made from a mix of fish and sago flour, deep-fried to golden perfection. These crunchy or chewy fish crackers are best enjoyed with a sweet and spicy chili dipping sauce. I love the rich, umami flavor of the fish, and the combination of textures makes it an irresistible snack that’s hard to stop eating.                </p>
